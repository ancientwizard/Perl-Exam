
This small code set is intended to evaluate a candidates ability to follow instructions,
express their problem resolving and communicate via documentation using both comments and POD.
There should not be any reason this code cannot pass the strictest of perlcritic evaluation.

This coding exam will require files from the samples/ repo where this exam was found.

Good luck, Ancient Wizard!
