
This small code set is intended to evaluate a programming candidates ability to follow instructions,
express their problem resolving ability and communicate the solution via documentation using both
comments and POD. There should not be any reason this code cannot pass the strictest of perlcritic
evaluation. You'll be successful if you understand OO programming and Perl's way of doing so.

TIPS:
 - Consider this a real exam, the code you submit will be critically examined
   for style, readability and reuse
 - You'll find instructions in the code explaining what needs to be accomplished,
   they should be replaced with professional comments expected to be included in
   a real module.
 - Avoid commentary and personal remarks, the submission will be reviewed for
   professionalism. If you have questions send then by email because we want you
   to be successful. We're happy to explain anything.
 - Polish is everything!
 - We're not interested in small code, the first bullet above is most important
 - Show off your knowledge of design patterns
 - Complete the coding and POD of the Simple::Container module
 - Complete the test set in t_C_Simple_Container.pl

This coding exam will require files from the samples/ git repo where this exam was found.

Good luck, Ancient-Wizard!
